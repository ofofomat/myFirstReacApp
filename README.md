# myFirstReacApp

A movie finder using OMDB API's and react.js
That was my first pratical interaction with React.Js and APIs too. Following JavaScript Mastery's video, I created this webpage and I really enjoyed it!

### First encounter

When first getting to the webpage, you'll be prompt with a search bar and a text saying "no movies have been found"
I tried to put another text that would only appear when accessing the page, but I could not find a way to do that on React. (I'm working on better understand JS and JSX before handling further things with React)

You can then type something and click on the search button. The webpage will send a request to the OMDB API and fetch data of movies that contain the text you insert in their titles
These data (10 movies total) will be displayed right bellow the search bar, taking place of that "no movies have been found" phrase.
When hovering over a movie, it scales a bit, darken the background image and show the year of release of that movie os series.

I also tried to make it search the data when clicking on enter but I could not make it too. Probably because of the lack of experience I have using React and JS itself.
